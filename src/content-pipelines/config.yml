# Content pipelines configuration
#
# Each entry defines a content pipeline that syncs docs from an external
# repository and uses the content-pipeline-update agent to update content articles.
#
# The update.ts script reads this file so you can run:
#   $ npx tsx src/content-pipelines/scripts/update.ts --id copilot-cli
#
# The workflow matrix in .github/workflows/content-pipelines.yml only needs `id`;
# everything else is read from this file.
#
# `exclusions` lists source topics the agent should skip during gap analysis.
# Use an empty list ([]) when nothing should be excluded. Example:
#   exclusions:
#     - Internal debugging commands
#     - Experimental telemetry flags
#

    cli-plugin-reference.md covers only plugin-specific content.
    All other CLI topics (hooks, MCP, skills, agents, permissions, etc.) belong in cli-command-reference.md even when they mention plugins.
