## About registration

When you’re prepared and ready to schedule your exam, you can register from any certification details page on the [{% data variables.product.prodname_certifications_singular %} Registration](https://learn.github.com/credentials) page.

During the scheduling process you can choose if you want to take the exam in a local test center or online. With an online proctored exam, you have the freedom to take the exam almost anywhere, but you’ll be responsible for making sure your computer and exam area meet security standards. Local test centers are a great choice if you prefer a quiet, pre-configured environment without the worry of testing your computer and downloading software to meet Microsoft’s security standards. If you decide to take your exam online, you’ll run a system pre-check to see if the computer you’ll be using meets the requirements before registering. For detailed instructions on how to perform the system pre-check, see [About online exams with Pearson VUE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/online-exams) or check the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/frequently-asked-questions?source=recommendations). If you have any technical or scheduling concerns, you can contact [support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/help).

The {% data variables.product.prodname_certifications_singular %} program partners with Pearson VUE to deliver both online and in-person certification exams. When you sign up for an exam, Pearson VUE will allow you to schedule certification exams no more than 90 days in advance. For any additional questions on this policy, see [Pearson VUE customer service for test-takers](https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/microsoft.html#contact). If you miss your scheduling window, you will need to repeat the scheduling steps.

Regardless of which mode you choose, you’ll need to meet specific identification requirements.

## About identification requirements

To gain admission to the testing center or online-proctored exam, you must present a valid, unexpired, and acceptable government-issued ID that has your name, photo, and signature. The first and last name you use to register for the exam must match exactly with the first and last name on the ID.

Acceptable forms include:

* International Travel Passport
* Driver's License
* Government ID card (with photo), such as state or provincial ID, visa, green card

If you do not have a qualifying ID issued from the country in which you are testing, a passport from your country of citizenship is required.

Failure to identify yourself and supply proper ID at the time of the exam is considered a missed appointment. There will be no refund of your exam fee.
