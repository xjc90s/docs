## About global security advisories

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %} There are two types of advisories: global security advisories and repository security advisories. {% endif %}**Global** advisories live in the [{% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}](https://github.com/advisories) and are grouped into three categories:
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.github-reviewed-overview %}
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.unreviewed-overview %}
* {% data reusables.advisory-database.malware-overview %}

> [!NOTE]
> {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} doesn't generate {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %} for unreviewed and malware advisories.

Every **repository** advisory is reviewed by the {% data variables.product.prodname_security %} curation team for consideration as a global advisory. We publish security advisories for any of the ecosystems supported by the dependency graph to the {% data variables.product.prodname_advisory_database %}.

Anyone can suggest improvements on any global security advisory. You can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted. The {% data variables.product.prodname_security %} curation team will review the submitted improvements.
