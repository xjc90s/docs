Enabling private vulnerability reporting gives security researchers a secure, structured way to disclose vulnerabilities directly in your repository. Once enabled, researchers can submit reports through  without resorting to public disclosure or informal channels. For background on private vulnerability reporting and how it fits into coordinated disclosure, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/concepts/vulnerability-reporting-and-management/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities).

The instructions in this article refer to enablement at repository level. For information about enabling the feature at organization level, see [AUTOTITLE](/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-an-organization).

## Configuring notifications for private vulnerability reporting

{% data reusables.security-advisory.private-vulnerability-reporting-configure-notifications %}

Notifications depend on the user's notification preferences. You will receive an email notification if:
* You are watching the repository.
* You have enabled notifications for "All Activity".
* In your notification settings, under "Subscriptions", then under "Watching", you have selected to receive notifications by email.

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
1. To start watching the repository, select **{% octicon "eye" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="eye" %} Watch**.

   ![Screenshot of the repository's main page. A dropdown menu, titled "Watch", is highlighted with an orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/repository-watch-dropdown.png)
