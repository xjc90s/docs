To help uncover problems that might be unique to your enterprise, we highly recommend performing a trial run of your migration. With a trial run, you'll learn:

* Whether the migration for a given repository can complete successfully.
* Whether you can get the migrated repository back to a workable state.
* How long a migration will take to run.

Trial runs can take place at any time, and work does not need to halt during the migration. To reduce the time it takes to complete your trial migrations, you can schedule the batches for your trial runs back-to-back. Users of those repositories can then validate the results on their own time.
