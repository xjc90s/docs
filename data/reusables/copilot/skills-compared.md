## Skills versus custom instructions

You can use both skills and custom instructions to teach {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} how to work in your repository and how to perform specific tasks.

We recommend using **custom instructions** for simple instructions relevant to almost every task (for example information about your repository's coding standards), and **skills** for more detailed instructions that {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} should only access when relevant.

To learn more about repository custom instructions, see [AUTOTITLE](/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions).
