When performing tasks, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} will decide when to use your skills based on your prompt and the skill's description.

When {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} chooses to use a skill, the `SKILL.md` file will be injected in the agent's context, giving the agent access to your instructions. It can then follow those instructions and use any scripts or examples you may have included in the skill's directory.
