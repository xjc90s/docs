You can see each {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} and SSH key that a member has authorized for API and Git access. Only the last several characters of each token or key are visible. If necessary, work with the member to determine which credentials you should revoke. Be aware that revoking a credential only removes the SAML authorization. It does not delete the underlying token or SSH key.
