   You can enable or disable push protection for individual patterns by using the toggle in the relevant column: "Enterprise setting" at the enterprise level, and "Organization setting" at the organization level.

   The data is limited to the scope, therefore the alert volume, false positives, bypass rate, or availability of custom patterns is reflective of user / alert activity within the _enterprise_ or _organization_.

   The {% data variables.product.github %} default may change over time as we increase precision and promote patterns.

   > [!NOTE] Organization administrators and security teams can override settings configured at the enterprise level.
