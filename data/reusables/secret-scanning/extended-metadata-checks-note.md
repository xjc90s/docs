> Starting on February 18, 2026, {% data variables.product.github %} will automatically enable extended metadata checks for repositories that have validity checks enabled. For repositories managed by security configurations, {% data variables.product.github %} will update those configurations and apply the feature to attached repositories. This is a one-time transition to help organizations benefit from enhanced metadata without manual configuration.
