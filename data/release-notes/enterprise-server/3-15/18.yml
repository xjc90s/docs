      Administrators can configure advanced SMTP settings for improved email delivery performance and reliability. These settings map to Postfix configuration parameters as documented in the Postfix documentation. New options include: 
        - IPv4-only relay: Route email to addresses at a specific email domain through an IPv4-only relay host. Setting `smtp.ipv4-only` to `true` configures Postfix to route all email to the domain specified in `smtp.relay-domain` through `smtp.relay-host` on port `smtp.relay-port` using IPv4 only.
        - Connection caching: Control connection reuse and caching (`smtp.connection-cache-time-limit`, `smtp.connection-reuse-count-limit`, `smtp.connection-cache-on-demand`).
        - Delivery concurrency: Tune parallel email delivery limits (`smtp.destination-concurrency-limit`, `smtp.initial-destination-concurrency`, `smtp.destination-concurrency-positive-feedback`).
        - Queue management: Configure retry timing and queue processing (`smtp.maximal-backoff-time`, `smtp.queue-run-delay`)
        - Connection limits: Set maximum inbound SMTP connections (`smtp.client-connection-count-limit`).

      **MEDIUM:** By supplying the migration identifier, an attacker could upload unauthorized content to another user’s repository migration export due to a missing authorization check. This could cause victims to download attacker-controlled migration archives, potentially impacting the integrity of downstream repository imports. GitHub has requested a CVE ID [CVE-2026-1355](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2026-1355) for this vulnerability, which was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/).

      **HIGH:** An authenticated attacker could exploit a URL redirection vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server to leak privileged authorization tokens by redirecting requests to an attacker-controlled domain. This could allow exfiltration of the `Actions.ManageOrgs` JWT and potential remote code execution. This vulnerability was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/). 
  bugs:
    - |
      Running `ghe-config-apply` could fail if Redis experienced transient connectivity issues during the configuration process. 
    - |
      On an instance configured behind a load balancer, users received unexpected secondary rate limit warnings during authentication when the `X-Forwarded-For` header included port numbers. This occurred because the system incorrectly ignored the header values containing ports, preventing proper client IP address identification. 
    - |
      Push rejections due to custom pre-receive hooks were not visible in the audit log. 
    - |
      Users could only view webhook deliveries from the previous three days. 
  changes:
    - |
      Administrators can configure database connection pool limits for the authentication and authorization services to improve performance on instances experiencing high concurrent request volumes. The limits can be adjusted using `ghe-config` keys:  `app.authnd.mysql-max-open-conns`, `app.authnd.mysql-max-idle-conns`, `app.authzd.db-resolver-max-open-conns`, and `app.authzd.db-resolver-max-idle-conns`. The default values remain unchanged (authnd: 100 max open and 100 max idle connections; authzd: 100 max open and 15 max idle connections). These settings should only be adjusted with guidance from GitHub Support. 
  known_issues:
    - |
      During an upgrade of GitHub Enterprise Server, custom firewall rules are removed. If you use custom firewall rules, you must reapply them after upgrading.
    - |
      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see [Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-web-ui/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account).
    - |
      On an instance with the HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` header configured for use behind a load balancer, all client IP addresses in the instance's audit log erroneously appear as 127.0.0.1.

      Admin stats REST API endpoints may timeout on appliances with many users or repositories. Retrying the request until data is returned is advised.

      When following the steps for [Replacing the primary MySQL node](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-the-primary-mysql-node), step 14 (running `ghe-cluster-config-apply`) might fail with errors. If this occurs, re-running `ghe-cluster-config-apply` is expected to succeed.
    - |
      Running a config apply as part of the steps for [Replacing a node in an emergency](/admin/monitoring-managing-and-updating-your-instance/configuring-clustering/replacing-a-cluster-node#replacing-a-node-in-an-emergency) may fail with errors if the node being replaced is still reachable. If this occurs, shutdown the node and repeat the steps.

      When restoring data originally backed up from a 3.13 or greater appliance version, the Elasticsearch indices need to be reindexed before some of the data will show up.  This happens via a nightly scheduled job.  It can also be forced by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair`.
    - |
      An organization-level code scanning configuration page is displayed on instances that do not use GitHub Advanced Security or code scanning.
    - |
      In the header bar displayed to site administrators, some icons are not available.
    - |
      When enabling automatic update checks for the first time in the Management Console, the status is not dynamically reflected until the "Updates" page is reloaded.
    - |
      When restoring from a backup snapshot, a large number of `mapper_parsing_exception` errors may be displayed.
    - |
      When initializing a new GHES cluster, nodes with the `consul-server` role should be added to the cluster before adding additional nodes. Adding all nodes simultaneously creates a race condition between nomad server registration and nomad client registration.
    - |
      Admins setting up cluster high availability (HA) may encounter a spokes error when running `ghe-cluster-repl-status` if a new organization and repositories are created before using the `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` command. To avoid this issue, complete the cluster HA setup with `ghe-cluster-repl-bootstrap` before creating new organizations and repositories.
    - |
      After a restore, existing outside collaborators cannot be added to repositories in a new organization. This issue can be resolved by running `/usr/local/share/enterprise/ghe-es-search-repair` on the appliance.
    - |
      After a geo-replica is promoted to be a primary by running `ghe-repl-promote`, the actions workflow of a repository does not have any suggested workflows.
    - |
      Unexpected elements may appear in the UI on the repo overview page for locked repositories.
